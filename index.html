                        <hr class="divider" />
                        <p class="text-muted mb-5">These were the list of questions asked of the two clinicians of Newport Academy on November 16th in an interview conducted with the members of PTK. Dante Clemente an officer of PTK conducted the interview for the College Project.  Q&A followed.
                           <ul>
      	                     <li>How do you define therapeutic recreation?</li>
      	                     <li>How have patients at this facility benefitted from therapeutic recreation?</li>
                             <li>What are the main obstacles and limitations when utilizing therapeutic recreation?</li>
                             <li>Is there a different goal with the practice of therapeutic recreation compared to conventional therapies?</li>
                             <li>Are there any patients who are initially opposed to receiving this therapy? What are their expectations when receiving it?</li>
                             <li>Is there any difference in effectiveness based on demographic, such as age, gender, or ethnicity?</li><br>
 
The interviewees stated their experience is that this type of therapy embraces all sorts of different not-necessarily verbal approaches to therapeutic recreation. Types of therapy that don’t use words are often most effective for those who have experienced some kind of trauma.  MMA, art therapy, yoga, and adventure therapy are the modalities that work well for those that don’t respond or succeed well with more traditional talk therapies. Traditionally these types of activities are thought to be most successful in younger people.  However, it seems to be most helpful for clients without more advanced language skills than you anticipate adults will possess. This is why it may so often be associated with children.  However, it can be successful for anyone who is having difficulty expressing themselves verbally.  
 
Talk therapy does not work for everyone.  Not everyone responds well to talk therapy.  The Newport Academy staff knows this and has approached their clients with a diverse range of activities designed to help them to cope and manage anxiety.
 
Has Newport Academy ever had a barrier to its success with non-conventional approaches? Yes, the barrier or obstacle is safety which works for some clients, but not all.  However, there are classes and activities that the clinicians cannot do with clients with explosive anger issues and the same goes for suicidal patients.  The activities are designed specifically to help individual clients with their particular issues at Newport Academy. This is not a one size fits all proposition.  Recreational therapies are used when traditional therapies may not be working.
 
Treatment plans have the same end goal to help improve someone’s functioning and help them address their mental health and symptoms.<br>
 
Since Newport has many different types of patients, we were curious if there were clients that rejected the approach that Newport uses.  There are some clients that are at the facility that don’t wish to be there, and sometimes those clients are pretty disinterested in any type of activity or therapeutic conversation with a clinician at the facility.  Obviously, if you are a teenager/adolescent that has been brought to the facility by their parents and isn’t interested in exploring their “issues” then the challenge becomes not one of the type of therapy, but more on establishing trust with this client.
 
Someone with ADHD would respond well to activities that help them focus, or for someone that has had extensive trauma, yoga may be what is needed for them to get “in their body” which can perhaps be most helpful to their healing.  Yoga is an activity that really seems to help clients with trauma that affects the body. Trauma does affect the nervous system, and resetting the nervous system is an objective for those clients.  Tapping, aka the Emotional Freedom Technique, is helpful for trauma cases.  The tapping technique is designed to lightly tap on parts of the body where you are potentially holding tension.  It combines ancient Chinese acupressure and modern psychology.  You tap on meridians in the body.  It is supposedly a desensitizing effect on the amygdala.  Panic attacks are especially responsive to this type of work.
 
The book The Body Keeps the Score speaks to the topic of the effect of stress on the human body.  The memory of trauma is, “encoded in the viscera and demands a radical shift in our therapeutic assumptions.”
 
Most of the focus at Newport is female adolescents.  However, all age groups seem to respond to therapeutic recreation.<br>
 
Jason (Schneiderman) had a question about the therapy and what is the difference between doing these activities like yoga, or MMA and doing these same activities therapeutically. The answer is that at Newport Academy all the teachers leading these classes are trained therapists and they are aware of the trauma that you have experienced, so they are designing the activities to help release some of the trauma. The mental health diagnosis is what drives the activity.  They are more interested in how the activities are impacting the body.  There is an awareness shared between clients and their clinicians, and
 
The objective is to find joy in play.  Anxiety and tension are released in play.  There is the insight gained from physical activites that are specifically designed by clinicians who are well-versed in this type of work.

Diana’s question is, how do you assess the outcome of the interventions made?  Resistance can sometimes provide insight as to how the treatment plan works for them. Barriers can be a way to determine the success of a particular therapy.  However, the client is the one who decides how and which therapies will be practiced and if something is discontinued it is usually as a result of a client deciding to stop that particular “modality” of recreational work.
 
Treatment teams are working together at Newport Academy to help design the most effective goals for each session.  Updates are regularly made by each of the team members.
 
Alex’s question what are the debates amongst clinicians about a particular client's care?  The answer from Newport Academy was there has not been too much debate regarding this type of disagreement at Newport.  There are opinions about the effectiveness of treatment, but it’s usually worked out between clinicians.  Everyone presents differently to each of their therapist and at different times of the day.  There is not a lot of pushback if one of the clinicians feels strongly about how effective a particular therapy is for a client. These issues are generally agreed upon at weekly meetings and planning sessions.
 
Diana’s question is whether one or the other of these types of modalities is better for different diagnoses and symptoms.   The response was that diagnosis may not matter, trauma is released in experiential therapies, and one size doesn’t fit all.  However, there is a belief that everyone can benefit from yoga including a person with an eating disorder, or depression. Everything is individualized, but there is a benefit to the client regardless of their issue.

How would you handle someone with PTSD and trauma?  Nervous systems are not regulated in these patients, so clinicians at Newport are trained, they are “trauma-informed.”  Triggering someone’s trauma is a concern for any session, and updating the clinicians is important, so that is done regularly. 
 
Nathan’s question about 14-21-year-olds and how their recreational therapies differ from those of younger patients.  The answer was that younger patients are often focused on playing with toys.  Structured experiential therapies including relaxation are more geared toward adolescents.
 
Katell’s question is, how do you register the success of these types of “experiential therapies” on these clients?  This is usually determined at 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day surveys that clients fill out.  They self-report their symptoms at these various points and things are restructured at individual working sessions with clients.
 
Newport Academy is pretty standardized in both CT and CA locations except for the clinicians themselves.<br>
 
What is the inspiration to work this way clinically?  The motivation was through special education, and kids who are shut down do seem to respond to recreational therapy.
 
Newport patients all seem to improve if they are open to treatment.  Engagement is key to their success.  Clients are most successful if they are participating fully.  Play therapy is not a way to successfully management of mental health, it’s just another tool in a clinician’s belt to help those that need it to find ways of accessing their own bodies.</p>
